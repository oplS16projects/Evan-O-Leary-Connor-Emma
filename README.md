# Information Presented Graphically Using Racket

### Statement
* Everyone is familiar with creating slideshow presentations in What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) interfaces, such as Google Slides
* Using Racket we can construct a presentation slides by implementing the slideshow library along with other helper libraries as needed
* How can we create an informative and visually pleasing presentation using Racket?

### Analysis
Explain what approaches from class you will bring to bear on the project. Be explicit: e.g., will you use recursion? How? Will you use map/filter/reduce? How? Will you use data abstraction? Will you use object-orientation? Will you use functional approaches to processing your data? Will you use state-modification approaches? A combination?

The idea here is to identify what ideas from the class you will use in carrying out your project. 

### Data set or other source materials
The data that our project requires is both textual and visual. Background research into our presentation's topic (a brief history of space exploration) will provide text and pictures to make our presentation visually pleasing. Although other images may be used and text corroborated by analyzing other sites our starting point is the Wikipedia page [Space Exploration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_exploration).

### Deliverable and Demonstration
Explain exactly what you'll have at the end. What will it be able to do at the live demo?

What exactly will you produce at the end of the project? A piece of software, yes, but what will it do? Here are some questions to think about (and answer depending on your application).

Will it run on some data, like batch mode? Will you present some analytical results of the processing? How can it be re-run on different source data?

Will it be interactive? Can you show it working? This project involves a live demo, so interactivity is good.

### Evaluation of Results
* Presentation will include a minimum of 10 slides
* Presentation will be visually appealing, informative, and have a consistent theme
* Presentation will include pictures 
* Presentation will potentially include video and sound (depending on library capabilities)
* Presentation will inform on the history of space exploration

## Architecture Diagram
Upload the architecture diagram you made for your slide presentation to your repository, and include it in-line here.

Create several paragraphs of narrative to explain the pieces and how they interoperate.

## Schedule

### First Milestone (Fri Apr 15)
* Outline of slides will be completed (w/placeholder info)
*	Titles for slides will be drafted, thus the total number of slides will be decided
*	Colors and styles will be decided roughly, can be changed later as needed
*	Draft slideshow will be made in PowerPoint, to be used as plan for Racket implementation
*	Screenshots of current slides

### Second Milestone (Fri Apr 22)
* Screenshots of current slides
*	Pictures, sound and video will be added
*	Most placeholder text should be replaced at this point
* Styles applied to text
* Slideshow will be looped

### Final Presentation (last week of semester)
* Implement final touches (make sure design scheme is agreed upon an dadjust if needed)
* Prepare for presentation logistics (who's laptop to use, developing any speech/instruction needed to introduce project, ect.)

## Group Responsibilities

### Evan O'Leary @olearyevan
* Will research and draft text to be used in the presentation
* Will select and obtain the images to be used in the presentation
* Will draft a Powerpoint presentation as a guide to be implemented using Racket
* Will create and order slides in Racket 

### Leonard Lambda @lennylambda
will work on...
